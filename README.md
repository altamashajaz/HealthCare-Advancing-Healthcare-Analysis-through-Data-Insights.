# HealthCare : Advancing Healthcare Analysis through Data Insights.

## Overview
This repository contains a healthcare analytics project designed to provide actionable insights for healthcare providers and optimize hospital operations. The analysis and interactive visualizations were created using Power BI, leveraging two datasets: `Patient Medical Records` and `Hospital Treatment Details`.

## Industrial Context
Healthcare providers face significant challenges in analyzing vast amounts of data to improve patient care and operational efficiency. Insights derived from this data can help reduce costs, improve patient outcomes, and enhance hospital performance.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to address key challenges in the healthcare industry by analyzing patient demographics, treatment costs, recovery ratings, and hospital performance. The objective is to uncover trends and actionable insights that drive decision-making.

## Key Findings
1. **Patient Demographics**:
   - Identified predominant age groups and gender distributions across diagnoses.
   - Highlighted trends in patient admissions over time, revealing seasonal patterns.

2. **Treatment Costs**:
   - Analyzed the most expensive treatments on average.
   - Compared treatment costs across hospitals to identify high-cost and low-cost providers.

3. **Recovery Ratings**:
   - Explored the effectiveness of different treatments based on recovery ratings and length of stay.
   - Investigated the correlation between patient demographics and recovery outcomes.

4. **Hospital Performance**:
   - Provided insights into hospital utilization rates, patient loads per doctor, and room efficiency.
   - Created a comprehensive comparison of hospital performance metrics.

## Recommendations
- Focus on improving recovery ratings for treatments with longer lengths of stay.
- Optimize resource allocation in hospitals with high patient loads and low recovery ratings.
- Monitor seasonal admission patterns to better plan for resource needs.
